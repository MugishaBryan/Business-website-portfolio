<!-- 'onload' working, lets change some content within the DOM tree 

    Add 'content' when on load event, why not have content in HTML?. Should this
    be here or in the HTML?  Perhaps if dynamically generated, loaded from
    database might make more sense, perhaps static text should just be in the
    HTML. More just questions, ideas to demonstrate and get them thinking about
    'Separation of Concerns' ideal vs reality 

    First, add event in HTML!  'onload' event (note event only triggers with
    window, document, html or body)

    see: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/event_onload.asp
    Note: Going to do more advance manipulation next week

        /* Add/link function to handle events */

        square.addEventListener('mouseover', (event) => changeColour('gray'));
        square.addEventListener('mouseout', (event) => changeColour('red'));

        function changeColour(colour) {
